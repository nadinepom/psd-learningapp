- **Training mode** — work through all questions batch by batch (10 at a time)
- **Review mode** — retry only the questions you previously answered incorrectly
- **Progress tracking** — persistent progress bar showing how many questions you've completed
- **Result screen** — summary of correct / incorrect answers after each batch
- **Light & dark mode** support

---

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) >= 18
- [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/) (`npm install -g expo-cli`)
- For iOS: Xcode + iOS Simulator
- For Android: Android Studio + Android Emulator

---

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

npm start
```

In the terminal output, press:
- `i` — open iOS Simulator
- `a` — open Android Emulator
- `w` — open in browser

## Architecture

This app uses **Expo Router** (file-based routing) with React Native, targeting iOS, Android, and web.

### Key Concepts

**Routing** — `app/` directory maps directly to routes. The root layout wraps everything in a `Stack` navigator.

**Training state** — managed via `TrainingContext` (`src/context/TrainingContext.tsx`), which persists progress using `AsyncStorage`. It tracks:
- seen questions
- incorrect questions
- current question (resume on relaunch)
- review mode flag

**Question flow**
1. `useQuestions` loads and filters questions (excludes already-seen ones)
2. `useQuestionSession` manages the current batch: selection state, reveal logic, result accumulation
3. After each batch of 10, a `ResultCard` is shown
4. Incorrect answers are saved; the user can review them from the home screen

**Theming** — light/dark mode via `constants/theme.ts` + `hooks/use-theme-color.ts`. `ThemedText` and `ThemedView` automatically apply the correct colors.

**Icons** — `components/ui/icon-symbol.tsx` abstracts platform differences:
- iOS: native SF Symbols via `expo-symbols`
- Android/web: Material Icons via `@expo/vector-icons`

### Path Aliases

`@/` maps to the project root (configured in `tsconfig.json`). Use it for all internal imports.
